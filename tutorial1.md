- React is a library for building user interfaces
- you need to make decision about other features such as routing, data fetching and more

### NextJS
- Is a react framework for building web applications
    - Framework = Complete solution with structure, conventions, and built-in tools
- uses react for building user interfaces
- Provides additional features that enable you to build production-ready apps
- features incluide routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling and more
- don't need to install additional packages as Nextjs provides everything you need

However, nextJS has opinions and converntions should be followed to implement these features

### With Next.js Framework:
```
✅ Automatic routing - create file, get route automatically generated
✅ Reusable components - import and use anywhere
✅ Built-in build process - optimized production bundles
✅ Environment variables - process.env.AWS_KEY (never exposed)
✅ TypeScript by default - catch errors during development
✅ Middleware auth - protect routes in one place
✅ Automatic code splitting - each page is separate bundle
✅ Server-side rendering - auth validation before HTML even reaches browser 
```

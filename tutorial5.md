# Tutorial 5 - Routing

- Nextjs has a filesystem based routing system
- urls you can access in your browser are determined by how you organize your files and folders in your code

# Routing conventions (File base routing)

1. All routes must live inside the app folder
2. Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
3. Each folder represents a segment of the URL path
